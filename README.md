# RANSAC

RANSAC algorithm tries to find the most fitting line in a group of points.

With this version the RANSAC algorithm is modified to find the most fitting plane instead of a line, meaning the function uses one more dimension.

The algorithm above is compatible with three.js library's points geometry format.
